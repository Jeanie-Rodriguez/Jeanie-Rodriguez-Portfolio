I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with over 20 years of experience in the United States Air Force as a Weather Technician. My career has been marked by a passion for delivering high-quality work with a focus on precision, effective communication, reliability, and innovative problem-solving.

I'm highly capable in operations, training, human resources, and project management, and have extensive experience in creating, editing, and managing technical documentation.
