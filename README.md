I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with over 20 years of experience in the United States Air Force as a Weather Technician. My career has been marked by a passion for delivering high-quality work with a focus on precision, reliability, effective communication, and innovative problem-solving.

I have extensive experience in operations and project management and in creating, editing, and managing a variety of technical documentation.
